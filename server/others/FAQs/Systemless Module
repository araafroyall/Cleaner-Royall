Usage Guidelines:

Avoid enabling or disabling the module multiple times in quick succession to prevent overlapping script executions.

Any changes to the module settings will take effect during the next cleaning cycle or interval.

For optimal performance, a 1-hour or 3-hour cleaning cycle is recommended.

Disabling the module from Magisk or KernelSU Manager will immediately stop the cleaning processes.


Uninstall Instructions:

Disable the module first and allow it to stop at the next cleaning cycle.

If not disabled properly, it will stop cleaning automatically after the next boot.


Monitoring and Maintenance:

Check notifications, logs, and module status regularly to ensure smooth operation.

Be aware that battery or memory-saving features may terminate the script. Monitor logs and notifications to verify the module's status.

Stable but not Bug-Free: While the module is stable, occasional bugs may occur. Regular monitoring is recommended.


Online Patches & Updates:

Weekly online patches improve functionality and address bugs. Keep your module updated.

Use the Patch Manager to remove unnecessary or downloaded patches for better resource management.


Important Notes:

This is one of the most powerful cleaning modules available, but misuse can cause issues. Use responsibly.

Stay proactive in checking logs or actions to ensure the module isn’t interrupted by the Android system.


With this robust module, you can keep your device optimized, clean, and free of unnecessary clutter without lifting a finger.
